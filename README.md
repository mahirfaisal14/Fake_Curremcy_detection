Introduction:

This project aims to develop a system for detecting fake currency notes in Bangladesh using image processing techniques. The system analyzes images of currency notes and applies various algorithms to determine their authenticity. By leveraging image processing, the project aims to provide a reliable and efficient solution to combat counterfeit currency in Bangladesh.

Features:

1.Image Acquisition: The system can acquire images of currency notes through various sources such as scanners, cameras, or mobile devices.
2.Preprocessing: Preprocessing techniques are applied to enhance the quality of acquired images, including noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and image resizing.
3.Feature Extraction: Relevant features are extracted from the currency note images, which may include texture, color, watermark patterns, and security features unique to genuine currency notes.
4.Classification: Machine learning or deep learning algorithms are employed to classify the currency notes as genuine or counterfeit based on the extracted features.
5.User Interface: The project includes a user-friendly interface where users can upload images of currency notes and receive instant feedback on their authenticity

Technologies Used:

1.Python: The primary programming language used for implementing image processing algorithms and machine learning models.
2.OpenCV: A popular open-source computer vision library used for image acquisition, preprocessing, and feature extraction.
3.TensorFlow or PyTorch: Deep learning frameworks utilized for training and deploying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for currency note classification.
4.Flask: A lightweight web framework used for developing the user interface and deploying the application on a web server.

Instructions for Usage:

1.Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
2.Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
3.Run the Flask application using the provided command (python app.py).
4.Access the application through a web browser and follow the instructions for uploading currency note images.
5.Receive feedback on the authenticity of the uploaded currency notes.
6.Acknowledgments: Special thanks to the contributors and researchers whose work has paved the way for advancements in image processing and counterfeit detection techniques.

Disclaimer: While the system aims to provide accurate results, it may not guarantee 100% accuracy in detecting counterfeit currency notes. Users should exercise caution and verify the authenticity of currency notes through official channels when in doubt.
